            <p>Headphones are an indispensable device for a phone. Choosing a reputable, affordable place to buy
                are factors you need to pay special attention to. Because on the market there are many shops
                selling headphones, but not all stores bring good quality. You should choose places specializing
                in headphones and audio equipment to bring a better experience.</p>
            <p>Earphone is the successor of headphone. This type of headset has a cotton pad that contains the
                speaker
                inside, making it possible to insert the headset directly into the ear. Because it is located in
                the ear
                canal, the earphone connects the sound to the ear more directly than the headphone, just a
                little
                vibration can be heard.</p>
